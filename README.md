### Information
Virtual environment named "MyEnv" was used on my Windows 11 Computer using command line, in the virtual environment I ran Python 3.11.0. I ran the virtual enviornment using the command, in the project folder:
    > venv\Scripts\activate

Development environment was command prompt, Visual Studio Code, and Git.

To run the program on the command line the way I did, after the virtual enviornment is running, use the command:
    > python.exe main.py

I did not use any other packages in the development of this project.

After the programming is running, just follow the directions on the command line. To run the program, re-enter the command above. 

I was not able to completely implement the qualitative logic so therefore, it is not functional and will crash the program. Only the penalty logic is working for everything.

In order to run the program, you must have all the files in the same directory. Atleast, that is how I built and tested it. I sorted the files and .txt files into their respective folders as stated on the project deliverables, however, it works and is tested when all files are in the same directory. This may not be required, but it is the only way that I ran it.
